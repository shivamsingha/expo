### üõ† Breaking changes

- **Android push notifications:** your Google API key specified in `google-services.json` must allow access to the Cloud Messaging API if you have restricted your API key to access only specific APIs. In the Google Cloud console, browse to [APIs & Services -> Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Find the API key that is associated with your app and click the pencil icon to edit it. Under "API restrictions", if the key is restricted, add "Firebase Installations API" and "Cloud Messaging" to the set of allowed APIs and save the changes. (Technical note: Google changed the underlying Firebase Cloud Messaging library in `com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:20.1.2` to depend on the Firebase Installations API, which applies API key restrictions. See Google's notes [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android#2020-02-27) and [here](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/blob/master/firebase-installations/API_KEY_RESTRICTIONS.md).)
